'Stomach Flu' is not considered a complex diagnosis in this context that would make a prescription refill unusual.\n    *   Abnormally High Claim Amounts (Prescription Refill > $150): NOT ACTIVATED. The claim amount of $54.86 is well below the $150 threshold.\n    *   Geographic Mismatches (Virtual Consultation from WY, AK, MT): NOT ACTIVATED. The procedure is 'Prescription Refill' and the patient state 'NC' is not one of the flagged states.\n    *   Suspicious Patterns (Multiple high-value claims, claims outside business hours, rapid succession): NOT ACTIVATED. No information in the claim suggests these patterns.\n\n3.  **DECISION PATHWAY:**\n    *   Primary trigger: No business rules were triggered that would flag this claim as an outlier.\n    *   Supporting factors: The claim amount, procedure type, diagnosis, and patient state all fall within acceptable parameters.\n\n4.  **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:**\n    *   Confidence level: High.\n    *   Key evidence: The direct data for claim CLM_10050 states `is_outlier: False`, and a thorough check against all defined business rules confirms no violations.\n    *   Recommended action: No review required based on outlier detection rules.\n\n5.  **SIMILAR PATTERNS:**\n    *   Historical similar cases: This claim aligns with typical, non-outlier claims for prescription refills for common ailments.\n    *   Pattern consistency: This claim is consistent with expected normal claim patterns.",

For example, should it be:\n1.  The total number of claims flagged as outliers by provider?\n2.  The percentage of a provider's total claims that are flagged as outliers?\n3.  Or do you have a specific time frame or claim type you'd like me to focus on for this analysis?\n\nOnce I have this clarification, I can construct a query to identify and rank providers based on their outlier rates.",
